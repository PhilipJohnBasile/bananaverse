## Gemini Features Used

BananaVerse leverages **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview** as its core AI engine, utilizing three primary features:

**1. Image Analysis & Generation**  
Gemini analyzes uploaded selfies to extract facial features, styling, and characteristics, then generates toy figurine versions with chibi proportions and glossy plastic textures. This preserves the person's identity while transforming them into collectible-style toys.

**2. Scene Creation**  
The AI generates cinematic adventure backgrounds from dynamically-created themes. Gemini creates unique environments (cyberpunk alleys, mystical forests, space stations) with appropriate lighting conditions and composition space for character placement.

**3. Intelligent Image Composition**  
Most importantly, Gemini seamlessly merges the generated figurine into the background scene with realistic scaling, shadows, and lighting integration. This creates cohesive final images that look naturally composed rather than simply overlaid.

**4. Dynamic Content Generation**  
Gemini generates fresh adventure scenarios on-demand, creating unique themes, lighting conditions, and story prompts each time, ensuring no two experiences are identical.

## Why Gemini is Central

These features are absolutely central to BananaVerse's functionality - without Gemini's multimodal image understanding and generation capabilities, the application simply couldn't exist. Every step relies on Gemini's ability to understand visual composition, artistic styles, and narrative context to produce engaging, high-quality results that users want to share.
